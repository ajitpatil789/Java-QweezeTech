Java Constructors
1. What is a Constructor?
A constructor is a special method in Java used to initialize objects. It is called automatically when an object is created.

Key Features of Constructors:
✅ The role of a constructor is to provide initial values to an object.
✅ A constructor is executed at the time of object creation (not before or after).
✅ It is used to initialize class-level variables.
✅ The constructor name must be the same as the class name.
✅ Constructors do not have a return type (not even void).
✅ Constructors cannot be declared as static, final, or abstract.
✅ Allowed access modifiers: public, protected, default, and private (used for Singleton patterns).
