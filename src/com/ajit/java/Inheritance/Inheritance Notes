1.What is Inheritance
 we can create a new class by extending an existing class. This is called inheritance.
 The new class is called a subclass, and the existing class is called a superclass.
 The subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from
 the superclass. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming.
